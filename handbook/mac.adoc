== Medium access control (MAC)

=== Overview

Agents offering the MAC service advise other agents on when they may be permitted to make transmissions, in an effort to reduce collisions and improve network throughput.

MAC protocols that use PDUs for channel reservation may support piggybacking of client data in the PDU. If such support is available, it is advertised using a non-zero `reservationPayloadSize` parameter. A `ReservationReq` should provide the payload data to be sent to a peer node (as part of RTS or equivalent PDU) to whom the reservation is made. If that node wishes to send payload data back (as part of CTS or equivalent PDU), it may send a `ReservationAcceptReq` in response to a `ReservationStatusNtf` to provide its payload data.

NOTE: Protocol data units (PDUs) are protocol-specific datagrams exchanged by nodes in a network. MAC protocls that use a handshake often use three basic type of PDUs -- request to send (RTS), clear to send (CTS) and acknowledgement (ACK).

==== Messages

Agents supporting the MAC service provide messages to request, grant and cancel reservations:

* https://unetstack.net/javadoc/org/arl/unet/mac/ReservationReq.html[`ReservationReq`^] => https://unetstack.net/javadoc/org/arl/unet/mac/ReservationRsp.html[`ReservationRsp`^] / `REFUSE` -- request a reservation
* https://unetstack.net/javadoc/org/arl/unet/mac/ReservationCancelReq.html[`ReservationCancelReq`^] => `AGREE` / `REFUSE` -- cancel a reservation
* https://unetstack.net/javadoc/org/arl/unet/mac/ReservationAcceptReq.html[`ReservationAcceptReq`^] => `AGREE` / `REFUSE` -- request piggybacking of payload in a reservation PDU
* https://unetstack.net/javadoc/org/arl/unet/mac/TxAckReq.html[`TxAckReq`^] => `AGREE` / `REFUSE` -- request transmission of acknowledgement payload
* https://unetstack.net/javadoc/org/arl/unet/mac/ReservationStatusNtf.html[`ReservationStatusNtf`^] -- sent to requestor or agent's topic if when a reservation-related events occur
* https://unetstack.net/javadoc/org/arl/unet/mac/RxAckNtf.html[`RxAckNtf`^] -- sent to requestor when an acknowledgement payload is received

==== Parameters

Agents offering the MAC service support the following parameters:

* https://unetstack.net/javadoc/org/arl/unet/mac/MacParam.html#channelBusy[`channelBusy`^] -- true if channel is busy, false otherwise
* https://unetstack.net/javadoc/org/arl/unet/mac/MacParam.html#reservationPayloadSize[`reservationPayloadSize`^] -- maximum size of payload (bytes) that can be piggybacked in a reservation PDU
* https://unetstack.net/javadoc/org/arl/unet/mac/MacParam.html#ackPayloadSize[`ackPayloadSize`^] -- maximum size of acknowledgement (bytes) that can be included in an ACK PDU
* https://unetstack.net/javadoc/org/arl/unet/mac/MacParam.html#maxReservationDuration[`maxReservationDuration`^] -- maximum duration of reservation in seconds
* https://unetstack.net/javadoc/org/arl/unet/mac/MacParam.html#recommendedReservationDuration[`recommendedReservationDuration`^] -- recommended duration of reservation in seconds (null, if unspecified)

==== Capabilities

Agents may support several optional capabilities:

*https://unetstack.net/javadoc/org/arl/unet/mac/MacCapability.html#RELIABILITY[RELIABILITY^]*

An agent advertising this capability must be able to send acknowlegements as part of the MAC protocol. The agent must support the `TxAckReq` request to provide acknowledgement payload to be transmitted to the peer node at the end of the reservation. On reception, this should generate a `RxAckNtf` on the peer node.

*https://unetstack.net/javadoc/org/arl/unet/mac/MacCapability.html#PRIORITY[PRIORITY^]*

Agents advertising this capability must honor priority settings in the reservation request.

*https://unetstack.net/javadoc/org/arl/unet/mac/MacCapability.html#TTL[TTL^]*

Agents advertising this capability must honor time-to-live settings in the reservation request.

*https://unetstack.net/javadoc/org/arl/unet/mac/MacCapability.html#TIMED_RESERVATION[TIMED_RESERVATION^]*

Agents advertising this capability must support scheduling of reservations in the future, through the use of the `startTime` attribute of the `ReservationReq`.

=== Basic MAC functionality

MAC agents advise other agents that wish to transmit (we shall call them _clients_) on when they may do so. MAC agents make channel reservations on behalf of their clients, as necessary. Some MAC protocols such as Aloha and TDMA may not require explicit handshake for reservation, while others such as MACA and FAMA may involve control packet exchanges between peer MAC agents on various nodes. In either case, a typical client with data to transmit starts by asking the prevailing MAC agent for a channel reservation:

[source, groovy]
----
// client wishes to transmit data to "destination" for specified "duration"
def mac = agentForService(Services.MAC)
if (mac) {
  def req = new ReservationReq(recipient: mac, to: destination, duration: duration) #<1>
  def rsp = request(req)
  if (rsp && rsp.performative == Performative.AGREE) {
    def ntf = receive(ReservationStatusNtf, timeout)       #<2>
    if (ntf && ntf.inReplyTo == req.messageID && ntf.status == ReservationStatus.START) {
      //    :
      // transmit data for requested duration
      //    :
    }
  }
}
----
<1> Send a channel reservation request.
<2> Wait for a channel reservation notification.

In the above sample code, error handling has been omitted for simplicity. In reality, you would want to have else clauses to handle reservation failures. The MAC agent not only sends a `ReservationStatusNtf[status: START]` notification, but also a `ReservationStatusNtf[status: END]` notification at the end of the reservation duration. The sample code above ignores this notification, but has to ensure that the transmission does not exceed the requested duration.

=== Working with MAC payloads

Messages such as `ReservationReq` and `ReservationStatusNtf` may carry payloads, when the MAC protocol supports them. When payloads are supported, additional messages such as `ReservationAcceptReq`, `TxAckReq` and `TxAckNtf` are available for clients to provide payloads to the MAC service provider to piggyback on the MAC PDUs. A typical exchange is illustrated in <<fig_mac>>.

[[fig_mac]]
.Typical message exchange for MAC with payloads. RRQ is a `ReservationReq`, `RSNTF` is a `ReservationStatusNtf`, `RARQ` is a ReservationAcceptReq`, `TXACKRQ` is a `TxAckReq`, and a `RXACKNTF` is a `RxAckNtf`. (1), (2) and (3) are optional payloads carried by the RTS, CTS and ACK PDUs respectively.

For a MAC reservation initiated by node A with node B, we elaborate on the steps for a full reservation lifecycle with payloads:

1. On node A, the client (agent) sends a `ReservationReq` to the MAC (agent), with an optional payload. The MAC accepts the request.
2. MAC on node A sends a RTS PDU with the payload to the MAC on node B.
3. MAC on node B generates a `ReservationStatusNtf[status: REQUEST]` message and publishes it on its topic. A client subscribing to this topic receives the notification.
4. If the client on node B wants to send back some payload with the CTS PDU, it immediately sends a `ReservationAcceptReq` to the MAC, with the payload.
5. The MAC accepts the request and responds back to node A's MAC with a clients PDU containing the payload.
6. The payload is delivered to the client on node A as part of a `ReservationStatusNtf[status: START]` message marking the start of the reservation time. At roughly the same time, the MAC on node B also sends a `ReservationStatusNtf[status: START]` message to its client.
7. During the reservation, the two nodes exchange data as they wish.
8. At the end of the reservation, the MAC agents on both nodes sends `ReservationStatusNtf[status: END]` messages to their respective clients.
9. If the client on node B wishes to provide an acknoledgment (with a payload), it responds back immediately with a `TxAckReq` message, which the MAC on node B accepts.
10. The MAC on node B sends a ACK PDU with the payload to the MAC on node A. The MAC delivers this acknoledgment payload to the client on node A using a `RxAckNtf` message.
