== Routing in larger networks

=== MISSION 2013 network

The MISSION 2013 experiment in Singapore featured a 7-node network that was deployed at sea (see <<fig_m13_map>>) for several weeks. The network operated in a challenging area with complex 3D bathymetry, several reefs and heavy shipping. During the experiment, we transmitted more than 40000 frames of data and collected statistics on communication performance across various links in the network. These performance statistics are embedded in the `Mission2013a` channel model in UnetStack. We use a simulated version of the MISSION 2013 network to learn how to set up and operate larger networks that require routing.

To start the simulated network, we simply run the `mission2013-network.groovy` simulation script:

While the MISSION 2013 network is not physically very large (only about 1.5 km across), the challenging environment kept the network from being fully connected, i.e., not all nodes could directly communicate with all others. The average frame delivery ratio (number of successfully delivered frames / number of transmitted frames) on each link is shown in <<tab_m13_fdr>>. The link quality is also shown on the map in <<fig_m13_map>>, with dark blue links being the good ones, dark green ones being the weak ones, and brownish one being the very poor link.

=== Connectivity without routing

During the MISSION 2013 experiment, node 21 was a gateway node with surface expression and connectivity to the Internet (via a 3G cellular network). All other nodes were on the seabed and not directly accessible. So let us start by exploring the connectivity from node 21 to other nodes:

.`Node 21`
[source, console]
----
> ping 22
PING 22
Response from 22: seq=0 rthops=2 time=10609 ms
Response from 22: seq=1 rthops=2 time=2656 ms
Response from 22: seq=2 rthops=2 time=2739 ms
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss
> ping 27
PING 27
Request timeout for seq 0
Response from 27: seq=1 rthops=2 time=2960 ms

> ping 28
PING 28

Response from 29: seq=1 rthops=2 time=3298 ms
Response from 29: seq=2 rthops=2 time=3515 ms
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss
> ping 31

Request timeout for seq 0
Response from 34: seq=1 rthops=2 time=19603 ms
Request timeout for seq 2
3 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 67% packet loss
----

We see that the connectivity to nodes 22, 28 and 29 is good, that to nodes 27 and 34 is poor, and to node 31 is non-existent.

=== Static routing

From <<fig_m13_map>> and <<tab_m13_fdr>>, we see that node 28 has good connectivity to nodes 31 and 34, so perhaps we could relay datagrams via node 28. Although the link between 22 and 27 seems to be better than the rest, the connectivity to that node is generally poor. Let us set up the following routes:

- Relay data between nodes 21 and 31 via node 28
- Relay data between nodes 21 and 34 via node 28

On node 21, we add routes to nodes 31 and 34:

.`Node 21`
[source, console]
----
> addroute 31, 28
> addroute 34, 28
> routes
1: to 31 via uwlink/28 [reliable, hops: 0, metric: 1.0]
2: to 34 via uwlink/28 [reliable, hops: 0, metric: 1.0]
----

On nodes 31 and 34, we add routes to node 21 via node 28:

.`Node 31`
[source, console]
----
> addroute 21, 28
> routes
1: to 21 via uwlink/28 [reliable, hops: 0, metric: 1.0]
----

.`Node 34`
[source, console]
----
> addroute 21, 28
> routes
1: to 21 via uwlink/28 [reliable, hops: 0, metric: 1.0]
----

Now, we can check out connectivity from node 21 to nodes 31 and 34 again:

.`Node 21`
[source, console]
----
> ping 31
PING 31
Response from 31: seq=0 rthops=4 time=15245 ms
Response from 31: seq=1 rthops=4 time=10673 ms
Response from 31: seq=2 rthops=4 time=10779 ms
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss
> ping 34
Response from 34: seq=0 rthops=4 time=26878 ms
Request timeout for seq 1
Request timeout for seq 2
3 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 67% packet loss
----

While the connectivity to node 31 seems okay, the connectivity to node 34 is still poor. We notice that the `seq=0` round-trip time is very close to the timeout of 30 seconds, and so try a ping with a longer timeout of 60 seconds:

.`Node 21`
[source, console]
----
> ping 34, 3, 60000
Response from 34: seq=0 rthops=4 time=38505 ms
Response from 34: seq=1 rthops=4 time=34393 ms
Response from 34: seq=0 rthops=4 time=22521 ms
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss
----

Much better!

The pings to nodes 31 and 34 show `rthops` (round trip hops) to be 4, which makes sense, since we have 2-hop routes in each direction. We can ask the routing agent for a trace to check what route the datagram took:

.`Node 21`
[source, console]
----
> trace 31
[21, 28, 31, 28, 21]
----

This shows that the datagram originated at node 21, passed through node 28 before reaching node 31. Then on the way back, it passed through node 28 again, and reached us back at node 21.

Let us next try to do something using the routes we created. We can get node 21 to ask node 31 to measure the range to node 34 and report it to us. This request will be relayed via node 28, since our routing tables are set up to do so. Remember to set `remote.enable = true` on node 31 before making the request from node 21:

.`Node 21`
[source, console]
----
> rsh 31, '?range 34'
AGREE
[31]: 873.67
----

As you can see from <<tab_m13_fdr>>, the connectivity between nodes 31 and 34 is poor in this simulated network. You may need to try this command several times before you get a range estimate. When the ranging fails, you should see the message "ERROR: No response from remote node" back from node 31, which by itself demonstrates successful routing.

TIP: If you don't have the patience to try a few times for range from node 31 to node 34, try getting a range from node 31 to 28, which will be much quicker: `rsh 31, '?range 28'`.

=== Route discovery

In the previous section, we learned how to set up static routes manually. But what if we are too lazy to determine the routes manually? Or if we don't have access to the nodes on the seabed to set up routes? We can use the route discovery agent to populate the routing tables.

To see how to do this, let us restart our MISSION 2013 simulation so that the routing tables are empty (alternatively we can remove the routes we created earlier by typing `delroutes` on nodes 21, 31 and 34). We can verify that the routing table is indeed empty:

.`Node 21`
[source, console]
----
> routes
>
----

Now, start a route discovery to node 31:

.`Node 21`
[source, console]
----
> rreq 31
OK
----

Patiently wait for a minute or two before checking the routing table on node 21:

.`Node 21`
[source, console]
----
> routes
1: to 29 via uwlink/29 [reliable, hops: 1, metric: 2.0]
2: to 34 via uwlink/34 [reliable, hops: 1, metric: 2.0]
3: to 22 via uwlink/22 [reliable, hops: 1, metric: 3.0]
4: to 28 via uwlink/28 [reliable, hops: 1, metric: 5.0]
5: to 31 via uwlink/28 [reliable, hops: 2, metric: 0.85]
6: to 27 via uwlink/27 [reliable, hops: 1, metric: 1.0]
----

Your routing table may differ, as the route discovery process is stochastic. We see that we now have a route to node 31 via node 28. Let us check the routing table on node 31 as well, to see if it has a corresponding entry for a route to node 21:

.`Node 31`
[source, console]
----
> routes
1: to 29 via uwlink/29 [reliable, hops: 1, metric: 2.0]
2: to 21 via uwlink/29 [reliable, hops: 2, metric: 1.7]
3: to 28 via uwlink/28 [reliable, hops: 1, metric: 5.0]
4: to 21 via uwlink/28 [reliable, hops: 2, metric: 4.2]
5: to 34 via uwlink/34 [reliable, hops: 1, metric: 2.0]
6: to 21 via uwlink/34 [reliable, hops: 3, metric: 1.6]
----

Indeed it does! In fact, it has 3 routes back to node 21, one via node 29, another via node 28 and the last via node 34. Of these routes, the route via node 28 has the largest metric, and so will be the route that is used. We can verify that by issuing a trace from node 21:

.`Node 21`
[source, console]
----
> trace 31
[21, 28, 31, 28, 21]
----

TIP: Since the route discovery process is stochastic, it may be useful to repeat the route discovery if good routes are not established after a single try. The `rreq` command can also be called with parameters to control the repetition. For example `rreq 31, 3, 6, 30` will initiate 6 route discoveries to node 31 looking for up to 3-hop routes spaced by 30 seconds between discoveries.
