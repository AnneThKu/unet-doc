Don't forget:

  ☐ What's new in UnetStack3?

Nice-to-haves:

  ☐ Make some of the TIPs become UNDER-THE-HOODs with a nice little car-bonnet-open icon (e.g. section 3.2)

println(phy[2].frameLength)
phy[1].frameLength = 64
println(phy[2].frameLength)
println(phy.MTU)
----

If you run the above code, you'll see that the changed DATA (2) channel frame length would also affect the MTU. The `phy.MTU`, `phy[1].MTU`, `phy[2].MTU`, `phy[1].frameLength` and `phy[2].frameLength` parameters are closely related. The MTU of a channel is its frame length, reduced by the size of the physical layer header. The MTU of the physical layer is the MTU of the DATA channel, since a datagram is by default transmitted using the DATA channel.

TIP: Developers may wish to consider using constants `org.arl.unet.phy.Physical.CONTROL` and `org.arl.unet.phy.Physical.DATA` instead of hard coding 1 and 2, for readability.
