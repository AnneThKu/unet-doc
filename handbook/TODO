Don't forget:

  ☐ What's new in UnetStack3?
  ☐ Promiscous mode
  ✔ Short circuit diagram @done (19-09-08 19:53)
  ✔ timestamped and timed transmissions @done (19-09-08 20:25)

Nice-to-haves:

  ☐ Make some of the TIPs become UNDER-THE-HOODs with a nice little car-bonnet-open icon (e.g. section 3.2)

Bugs:

(Unet audio)
  ☐ Recording times seem to be incorrect
  ☐ Timed TxFrameReq seem to transmit with 1 ms offset

(logs)
  ☐ log folder assumes current directory
