                    About 71% of Earthâ€™s surface is covered with water, and about 97% of the water is in our oceans. Although the ocean plays a critical role in everything from the air we breathe to daily weather and climate patterns, we know very little about it. To really understand our oceans, we need a way to sense and observe the numerous complex processes that drive the ocean environment, and to report the data collected back to our data centers. While cabled ocean observatories have been established in a few locations, they are too expensive to setup and maintain for large scale data collection across the vast oceans.

                    Over the past few decades, wireless communication technology has percolated into every aspect of our lives, and we have come to take it for granted. This technology forms the bedrock of wireless sensor networks, allowing us to gather data with ease. Most of the wireless communication technology we use relies on electromagnetic waves (e.g. radio waves, visible light) that get rapidly absorbed by water. Hence the technology is ineffective for underwater communication, except at very short distances or extremely low data rates. Most underwater communication systems today use acoustic waves, which can travel long distances in the right conditions. At short distances in clear waters, optical communication systems are sometimes used for high speed communications. Although these communication technologies can be leveraged to establish point-to-point communication links, these links do not integrate well with networking technology available today.

                    UnetStack3, a software framework developed as part of the Underwater networks (Unet) project, is a collection of technologies that allows us to extend communication networks underwater, be it via acoustic, optical, or even wired links. While it is called an <i>underwater network</i> stack, UnetStack3 supports nodes and links below and above water.
